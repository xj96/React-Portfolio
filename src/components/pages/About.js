          Full Stack Web Developer with graphic design experience in logo
          creation and branding. Recently earned a certificate from Columbia
          Engineering School in Full-Stack Development to complement my skills
          as a graphic designer. Skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js,
          and responsive web design with mobile first development. Strengths
          include being well organized, time efficient, creative thinking, and
          working well in team-oriented environments that are task driven. With
          each project, my aim is to create a UI that users find easy to
          navigate and is appealing to the eye with current trends in design. I
          applied these skills and strengths on a recent project that allows
          users to create an account, create tasks, write notes, organize a
          calendar, and manage their time more efficiently. I'm excited to
          leverage my skills as a web developer and a graphic designer to build
          useful and engaging web applications for users.
